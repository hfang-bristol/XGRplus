Motivation We are pleased to introduce an updated version of our XGR software, which has gained increasing popularity in genomics research since its first release (see Genome Medicine 2016). This update features a newly designed web server, called XGR Plus or XGR+, now made available here to all users for free and without any login requirements. It enables almost real-time enrichment and subnetwork analyses for a user-input list of genes, SNPs, genomic regions, or protein domains, leveraging ontologies, networks, and many other knowledgebase resources, such as functional genomic datasets about e/pQTL, promoter capture Hi-C, and enhancer-gene maps. Besides, the web server is user-friendly, very suitable for users who are unfamiliar with coding. One of the major challenges in genomics research is how to bridge the gap between generated genomic summary data and downstream knowledge discovery. We define genomic summary data as a list of genes or SNPs (more generally, genomic regions), along with their significance levels (e.g. p-values). We are leading the field in making sense of genomic summary data for knowledge discovery through developing approaches and tools that have been verified to be efficient and effective, including XGR (see Genome Medicine 2016), dnet (see Genome Medicine 2014), Priority index (see Nature Genetics 2019), and dcGO (see Nucleic Acids Research 2013). Building upon our previous approaches that have stood the test of time (with most of citations received in the past two years), and also incorporating the growing knowledgebase of ontologies and networks, XGR+ offers seven analysers for enrichment and subnetwork analyses, each doing specific interpretations tailored to genomic summary data at the gene, SNP, genomic region, and protein domain levels.
